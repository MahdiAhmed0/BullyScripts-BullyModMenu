-- and for sure you can run another undircted function from a Main() or MissionSetup().
-- You can learn a lot by understanding the code. It's a small chunk of the original script, but it contains a few concepts that can assist you in any future project, really good concepts.

-- The story behind this script: I was developing a script 'Mission' and there was too much to debug. So, I built this menu to assist me with debugging my 'Mission'.
-- The most helpful debugging feature was the 'Reset Camera' option because the camera was glitching all the time. As a result, I had to debug the camera most of the time.

-- IMPORTANT: There is no license for this script. Much of its original code is missing, and it was testing code not intended to be published by any means.
